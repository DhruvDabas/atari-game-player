# Atari-style Game for DQN Reinforcement Learning

This project implements a simple **Atari-style Breakout game** in Python using Pygame. It is designed as an environment to train reinforcement learning agents, specifically using the **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** algorithm.

## Features

- Classic Breakout gameplay: control the paddle at the bottom to bounce the ball and destroy blocks.
- Blocks reset every time the ball is missed.
- Random timed restarts for diverse training scenarios.
